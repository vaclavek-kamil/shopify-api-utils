1. `npm i`
2. If you want to add new stuff, just copy one of the existing files, change the code and name to suit your needs (preferably keep the file name and the function name same as the graphql naming), import it in index.js and add it to the functions.
3. `node index.js --<{function name}>` (same as file name)
